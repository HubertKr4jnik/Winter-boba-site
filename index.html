                <p>Don't freak out - it's just a decoration 🕷️. In the Ukraine Christmas trees are decorated with ornaments in the shape of spiders or spider webs. It's said that they bring good luck. It's believed that this tradition goes way back to when a poor woman couldn't afford any ornaments to put onto her Christmas tree. When she woke up the next mornign the tree was covered in spider webs that sparkled in the sun</p>

                <h2>Christmas Chicken</h2>
                <p>Christmas is all about food. Believe it or not but the traditional Japanese meal is... KFC. That's right Kentucky Fried Chicken. Each year people flock to the American fast food chain to get "Kurisumasu ni wa kentakkii!" - “Kentucky For Christmas!”. This is the result of a marketing campaign in 1974 🍗</p>
